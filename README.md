# Donors_for_CharityML
Our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than `$50,000`. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organisations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can try to infer this value from other publicly available features.
